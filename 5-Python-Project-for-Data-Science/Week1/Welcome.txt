Course Introduction

Welcome to this Python Project!  

This mini-course is intended to be a follow-on to the 
Python for Data Science, AI and Development
 course for you to demonstrate basic Python skills that you have acquired in that course.

In this mini-course you will be assuming the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst. In this role you will be given a scenario and data to begin your Python project. During this process you will perform specific tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard. You will then submit your Python notebook and screenshots for your peers to review and evaluate your work.

To be successful in completing this project, you should have already completed the 
Python for Data Science, AI and Development
 course or have equivalent skills for working with Data and Python.
