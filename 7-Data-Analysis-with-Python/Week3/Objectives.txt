In this module, you will learn what is meant by exploratory data analysis, and you will learn how to perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data. You will learn about putting your data into groups to help you visualize the data better, you will learn how to use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables, and you will learn how to use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them.

Learning Objectives

Implement descriptive statistics
Demonstrate the basics of grouping
Describe data correlation processes
Describe why and how to apply the Chi-Squared test

Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned how to:

Describe Exploratory Data Analysis: By summarizing the main characteristics of the data and extracting valuable insights.

Compute basic descriptive statistics: Calculate the mean, median, and mode using python and use it as a basis in understanding the distribution of the data.

Create data groups: How and why you put continuous data in groups and how to visualize them.

Define correlation as the linear association between two numerical variables: Use Pearson correlation as a measure of the correlation between two continuous variables

Define the association between two categorical variables: Understand how to find the association of two variables using the Chi-square test for association and how to interpret them.
