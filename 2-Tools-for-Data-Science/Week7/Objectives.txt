Watson Studio is a collaborative platform for the data science community and is used by Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Developers, and Data Stewards to analyze data and construct models. In this module, you will learn about Watson Studio and IBM Cloud Pak for data as a service. Then you will create an IBM Watson Studio service and a project in Watson Studio. After creating the project, you will create a Jupyter notebook and load a data file. You will also explore the different templates and kernels in a Jupyter notebook. Finally, you will connect your Watson Studio account to GitHub and publish the notebook in GitHub.
