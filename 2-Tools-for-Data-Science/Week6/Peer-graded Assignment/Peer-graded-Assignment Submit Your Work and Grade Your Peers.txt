Peer-graded Assignment: Submit Your Work and Grade Your Peers

Congratulations on finishing all the modules of this course. This week, you'll work on your final assignment, which will be graded by your peers. 

This course introduced you to multiple data science tools, and in this final project, you will use Jupyterlite Notebook, one of the easiest tools to share publicly. 

Leveraging Jupyterlite Notebook on Skills Network labs, you will create your Jupyterlite Notebook (in English) and share it via a public GitHub link.
