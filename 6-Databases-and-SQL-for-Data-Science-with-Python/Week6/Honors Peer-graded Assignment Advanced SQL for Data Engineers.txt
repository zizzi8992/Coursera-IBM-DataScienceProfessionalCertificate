You passed!
Congratulations. You earned 20 / 20 points. Review the feedback below and continue the course when you are ready. You can also help more peers by reviewing their submissions.
InstructionsMy submissionDiscussions
For this hands-on assignment, you will be working on several real-world datasets available from the Chicago Data Portal. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data engineer would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.

You will write SQL code to create a view that limits the data available to a user, create a stored procedure that users can run to update Leader Icons in the table, and then enclose that update code in a transaction to ensure that if an error occurs, your data remains in a consistent state.

Follow the instructions in the assignment to complete all the problems. Then share the Queries and Results with your peers for reviewing.
