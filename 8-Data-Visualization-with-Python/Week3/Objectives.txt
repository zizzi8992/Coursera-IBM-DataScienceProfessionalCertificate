Advanced visualization tools are sophisticated platforms that provide a wide range of advanced features and capabilities. These tools provide an extensive set of options that help create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. In this module, you will learn about waffle charts and word cloud including their application. You will explore Seaborn, a new visualization library in Python, and learn how to create regression plots using it. In addition, you will learn about folium, a data visualization library that visualizes geospatial data. Furthermore, you will explore the process of creating maps using Folium and superimposing them with markers to make them interesting. Finally, you will learn how to create a Choropleth map using Folium.
